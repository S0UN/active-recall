# Text Preprocessing Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive text preprocessing service to improve OCR text quality before classification.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created ITextPreprocessor Interface (`src/main/services/preprocessing/ITextPreprocessor.ts`)
- Defines contract for text preprocessing services
- Supports dependency inversion principle

### 2. Implemented TextPreprocessor Service (`src/main/services/preprocessing/impl/TextPreprocessor.ts`)
- Basic text cleaning: removes UI artifacts, special characters, excessive whitespace
- Integrates with Python SymSpell library for spell checking
- Handles OCR-specific issues like line numbers, file paths, git markers

### 3. Created Python Spell Checker (`src/main/services/preprocessing/impl/spellcheck.py`)
- Uses SymSpell library for fast, accurate spell correction
- Preserves technical terms and code-related words
- Downloads English frequency dictionary automatically
- Conservative correction to avoid over-correcting valid technical terms

### 4. Integrated with DistilBARTService
- Updated DistilBARTService to accept optional ITextPreprocessor via dependency injection
- Falls back to basic preprocessing if advanced preprocessing fails
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 5. Updated Dependency Injection Container (`src/main/container.ts`)
- Registered TextPreprocessor as singleton service
- Available for injection into any service that needs text preprocessing

### 6. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- TextPreprocessor.test.ts: 14 unit tests covering all preprocessing functionality
- DistilBARTService.integration.test.ts: Integration tests with preprocessor
- DistilBARTService.e2e.test.ts: End-to-end tests showing improved classification

### 7. Python Environment Setup
- Created virtual environment (venv) for Python dependencies
- Added requirements.txt with symspellpy dependency
- Updated .gitignore to exclude Python artifacts

## Benefits

1. **Improved Classification Accuracy**: Clean text leads to better classification results
2. **Spell Correction**: Fixes common OCR errors like "teh" â†’ "the"
3. **UI Artifact Removal**: Removes navigation elements, file paths, status indicators
4. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add more preprocessing steps in the future
5. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

## Usage

The preprocessor is automatically injected into DistilBARTService. No code changes needed for existing functionality.

For direct usage:
```typescript
const preprocessor = container.resolve<ITextPreprocessor>('TextPreprocessor');
const cleanedText = await preprocessor.preprocess(ocrText);
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. The frequency dictionary will be downloaded automatically on first use.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for stripping boilerplate UI elements (planned in TODO.md)
- Implement text chunking for better classification of long texts
- Add language detection to use appropriate dictionaries
- Consider implementing pure TypeScript spell checker to avoid Python dependency

# Segmented Classification Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a segmented classification approach to improve classification accuracy on noisy OCR text by analyzing individual text segments rather than the full text.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created ITextSegmenter Interface (`src/main/services/preprocessing/ITextSegmenter.ts`)
- Defined TextSegment type with text, startIndex, endIndex, and type
- Defined SegmentationOptions for configuring min/max lengths and preferred method
- Provides contract for text segmentation services

### 2. Implemented TextSegmenter Service (`src/main/services/preprocessing/impl/TextSegmenter.ts`)
- Primary strategy: sentence-based segmentation with abbreviation handling
- Fallback: line-based segmentation for non-sentence content (code, bullet points)
- Supports min/max length constraints for segments
- Handles edge cases: empty text, whitespace-only, no delimiters
- Injectable service following DI principles

### 3. Created ISegmentedClassifier Interface (`src/main/services/analysis/ISegmentedClassifier.ts`)
- Defined SegmentClassificationResult for individual segment results
- Defined SegmentedClassificationResult for overall classification
- Provides contract for segmented classification services

### 4. Implemented SegmentedClassificationService (`src/main/services/analysis/impl/SegmentedClassificationService.ts`)
- Takes ITextSegmenter, ITextPreprocessor, and IClassificationService as dependencies
- Segments text, preprocesses each segment, classifies individually
- Returns highest confidence classification as overall result
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle

### 5. Updated Dependency Injection Container (`src/main/container.ts`)
- Registered TextSegmenter as singleton service
- Available for injection into services needing text segmentation

### 6. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- TextSegmenter.test.ts: 13 tests covering all segmentation strategies
- SegmentedClassificationService.test.ts: 7 tests covering integration and edge cases
- All tests follow TDD principles with behavior-driven testing

## Benefits

1. **Noise Reduction**: UI elements in one segment don't affect educational content in another
2. **Better Accuracy**: One clear educational sentence can correctly classify entire screen
3. **Maintainable**: Each component has single responsibility
4. **Extensible**: Can add new segmentation strategies (e.g., paragraph-based, semantic)
5. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

## Usage

The segmented classifier can be used directly or integrated into the Orchestrator:

```typescript
const segmentedClassifier = container.resolve<ISegmentedClassifier>('SegmentedClassifier');
const result = await segmentedClassifier.classifySegmented(ocrText);

if (result.highestConfidence > THRESHOLD) {
  // Handle studying classification
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Register SegmentedClassificationService in container (not done yet to avoid breaking existing code)
2. Integrate into Orchestrator to replace direct classification
3. Configure segmentation parameters based on real-world testing
4. Add support for audio segmentation when audio input is implemented
5. Consider refactoring DistilBARTService to remove preprocessing responsibility
