## Current System Architecture Analysis

### Overview
The system follows a pipeline architecture: **CAPTURE → DISTILL → EMBED → ROUTE**

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Schemas (`src/core/contracts/schemas.ts`)
**Key Data Structures**:
```typescript
// Input to the system
Batch {
	batchId: UUID
	topic: string
	entries: Entry[]
	sessionMarkers?: SessionMarker
}

// After normalization
ConceptCandidate {
	candidateId: string (deterministic)
	rawText: string
	normalizedText: string  
	contentHash: string
	source: SourceInfo
}

// After LLM distillation
DistilledContent {
	title: string (1-100 chars)
	summary: string (50-500 chars)
	keyPoints: string[]
	studyQuestions: string[]
	confidence: number
}

// After embedding generation
VectorEmbeddings {
	vector: number[]
	metadata: EmbeddingMetadata
}

// Final storage
ConceptArtifact {
	id: UUID
	candidateId: string
	distilledContent: DistilledContent
	embeddings: VectorEmbeddings
	folderPath: FolderPath
	confidence: number
}
```

#### 2. SmartRouter Pipeline (`src/core/services/impl/SmartRouter.ts`)
**Current Flow**:
1. `route(candidate)` → `executeRoutingPipeline()`
2. `distillContent()` → OpenAI distillation 
3. `generateEmbeddings()` → Text embedding
4. `checkForDuplicates()` → Vector similarity for duplicates
5. `findBestFolders()` → Vector similarity for folder matching
6. **`makeRoutingDecision()` ← THIS IS THE TODO WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT**

**Current makeRoutingDecision() Logic** (PROBLEMATIC):
```typescript
// Simplified current logic:
- Get folder matches from vector similarity
- If no matches → "Unsorted"
- If high similarity (>duplicate threshold) → "Duplicate"  
- If medium similarity → Direct placement in best match
- Missing: LLM intelligence, new folder creation, proper academic organization
```

#### 3. Vector Database Integration (`src/core/services/impl/QdrantVectorIndexManager.ts`)
**Current Capabilities**:
- Store concept embeddings with folder metadata
- Search by title similarity (duplicate detection)
- Search by context similarity (folder matching)
- **Missing**: Folder centroid calculations, discovery relationships

#### 4. LLM Integration (`src/core/services/impl/OpenAIDistillationService.ts`)
**Current Usage**: Only for distillation (concept extraction)
**Missing**: Folder placement decisions, academic domain intelligence

### Folder System Current State

#### Folder Structure
```typescript
FolderManifest {
	path: FolderPath
	name: string
	description?: string
	createdAt: Date
	provisional: boolean  // Temporary folders needing proper names
}

FolderPath {
	segments: string[]
	depth: number
	toString(): string // "Mathematics/Calculus/Derivatives"
}
```

#### Repository Layer (`src/core/contracts/repositories.ts`)
```typescript
IFolderRepository {
	create(path, manifest)
	findByPath(path)
	listChildren(path)
	rename(oldPath, newPath)
	delete(path)
	findProvisional()
	findLarge(minArtifacts)  // For expansion triggers
}

IConceptArtifactRepository {
	save(artifact)
	findByPath(path)
	updatePath(artifactId, newPath) // For folder moves
}
```

## Identified Problems

### 1. **Broken makeRoutingDecision() Logic**
**Problem**: Current implementation has TODO placeholder with broken multi-folder logic
**Impact**: Poor folder organization, concepts go to "Unsorted"
**Evidence**: Lines 405-432 in SmartRouter.ts

### 2. **No Academic Domain Intelligence**
**Problem**: System doesn't understand academic hierarchy conventions  
**Impact**: Creates folders at wrong abstraction levels
**Example**: "Group Theory" might create top-level folder instead of "Mathematics/Algebra/Abstract Algebra"

### 3. **Cold Start Problem** 
**Problem**: Empty system has no folder structure for similarity matching
**Impact**: First concepts have nowhere intelligent to go
**Solution Needed**: Bootstrap mode with batch analysis

### 4. **Large System Context Problem**
**Problem**: Giving LLM entire folder structure (1000s of folders) is expensive and inaccurate
**Impact**: High API costs, poor LLM decisions
**Solution Needed**: Smart context filtering

### 5. **No Discovery System**
**Problem**: Content lives in silos, no cross-folder discovery
**Impact**: Poor content discoverability, missed learning connections
**Solution Needed**: Vector-based discovery with single source of truth

### 6. **No Folder Expansion Intelligence**
**Problem**: Folders can grow indefinitely without organization
**Impact**: Unwieldy folder contents, poor browsing experience
**Solution Needed**: Size-based reorganization triggers

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Core Design Principles
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept lives in exactly one folder
2. **Vector-Based Discovery**: Use existing vector DB for cross-folder relationships  
3. **Academic Intelligence**: LLM understands scholarly organization conventions
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: System gets better organized as it grows
5. **Context Efficiency**: Smart filtering prevents LLM context overload

### New Components

#### 1. IIntelligentFolderService
```typescript
interface IIntelligentFolderService {
	// Main routing decision with academic intelligence
	analyzePlacement(request: PlacementAnalysisRequest): Promise<PlacementDecision>
	
	// Bootstrap empty systems
	bootstrapSystem(initialTopics: DistilledContent[]): Promise<BootstrapResult>
	
	// Smart context filtering for large systems
	getRelevantContext(topicEmbedding: number[]): Promise<FolderContext[]>
	
	// Folder reorganization intelligence
	analyzeForReorganization(folderPath: string): Promise<ReorganizationPlan>
}

interface PlacementAnalysisRequest {
	distilledTopic: DistilledContent
	systemState: SystemState  // BOOTSTRAP | GROWING | MATURE
	relevantFolders: FolderContext[]
	existingStructure: FolderTree
}

interface PlacementDecision {
	action: 'place_existing' | 'create_new' | 'reorganize_first'
	
	// For placement
	primaryLocation?: string
	confidence: number
	
	// For new folder creation  
	newFolderPath?: string
	hierarchyLevel: 'domain' | 'field' | 'subfield' | 'topic' | 'technique'
	intermediateCreations?: string[] // Parent folders to create
	
	// For reorganization
	reorganizationPlan?: ReorganizationPlan
	
	reasoning: string
	academicDomain: string
}
```

#### 2. FolderDiscoveryService
```typescript
interface IFolderDiscoveryService {
	// Get unified folder contents (local + discovered)
	getFolderContents(folderPath: string): Promise<UnifiedFolderContents>
	
	// Find concepts from other folders via similarity
	findDiscoveredConcepts(folderPath: string, threshold: number): Promise<DiscoveredConcept[]>
	
	// Find related folders via centroid similarity  
	findRelatedFolders(folderPath: string, threshold: number): Promise<RelatedFolder[]>
}

interface UnifiedFolderContents {
	// Content that actually lives here
	localConcepts: ConceptArtifact[]
	localSubfolders: string[]
	
	// Content discoverable from other areas
	discoveredConcepts: DiscoveredConcept[]
	relatedFolders: RelatedFolder[]
}
```

#### 3. FolderCentroidManager
```typescript
interface IFolderCentroidManager {
	// Calculate and store folder centroids
	calculateCentroid(folderPath: string): Promise<number[]>
	updateCentroid(folderPath: string): Promise<void>
	
	// Search similar folders by centroid
	findSimilarFolders(folderPath: string, limit: number): Promise<FolderSimilarity[]>
}
```

### System State Management

#### Bootstrap Mode (< 20 concepts total)
**Trigger**: Empty system or very few concepts
**Logic**: 
1. Collect first 15-20 distilled topics in batch
2. LLM analyzes batch for natural domain groupings
3. Creates initial hierarchical folder structure
4. Distributes concepts into created folders
5. Switches to normal mode

#### Growing Mode (20-500 concepts)
**Trigger**: Has basic structure but not overwhelming
**Logic**:
1. Use full context for LLM decisions
2. Build folder centroids as system grows
3. Monitor for reorganization opportunities

#### Mature Mode (500+ concepts)  
**Trigger**: Large established system
**Logic**:
1. Smart context filtering (vector search for relevant folders)
2. Folder centroid-based discovery
3. Size-based expansion triggers
