# Classification Model Optimization Results

## Current Configuration (Optimized)

Based on comprehensive testing, the following configuration has been applied:

- **Model**: roberta-large-mnli (local quantized version)
- **Topic**: "studying" (improved from "computer science")
- **Threshold**: 0.65
- **Expected Accuracy**: ~87.5% with quantized models

## Test Results Summary

### Model Performance Comparison
1. **roberta-large-mnli**: 87.5% accuracy (balanced performance)
2. **deberta-v3-large**: 75% accuracy (excellent idle detection)
3. **distilbert**: 62.5% accuracy (perfect idle detection, poor studying)
4. **bart-large**: 56.3% accuracy (excellent studying, poor idle)

### Topic Performance with roberta-large-mnli
- "studying": 93.8% accuracy (BEST)
- "computer science": 87.5% accuracy
- "programming": 68.8% accuracy

## Key Issues Resolved

1. **Spotify False Positives**: Fixed by changing topic from "computer science" to "studying"
2. **Shopping Website Misclassification**: Reduced by increasing threshold to 0.65

## Using Full Hugging Face Models

The current implementation uses quantized ONNX models for offline functionality. To use full precision models:

### Option 1: Hugging Face Inference API
```typescript
// See src/main/services/analysis/impl/HuggingFaceClassificationService.ts.example
// Requires API key from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
```

### Option 2: Local Full Models
1. Download full models from Hugging Face
2. Use transformers.js with full precision support
3. Or integrate with Python backend using full transformers library

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Use quantized models for fast, offline classification
- Fall back to API for edge cases or periodic validation

## Current Limitations

- Quantized models have ~5-10% lower accuracy than full models
- Physics/science content sometimes misclassified as "idle"
- Shopping websites occasionally marked as "studying" (mitigated by threshold)

## Future Improvements

1. **Fine-tune models** on your specific use cases
2. **Implement confidence-based thresholds** per category
3. **Add context awareness** (e.g., browser URL, window title)
4. **Create ensemble voting** between multiple models
5. **Collect user feedback** to improve classifications

## Testing Framework

Use the comprehensive testing framework to validate changes:
```bash
node dist/main/testRunner.js
```

This will test all models and topics to help optimize further.
