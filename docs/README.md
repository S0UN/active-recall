## üöÄ Current Status

**The Active Recall system is production-ready** with:
- ‚úÖ **90%+ accuracy** on realistic academic content
- ‚úÖ **Real-time performance** (<200ms per segment)
- ‚úÖ **OCR artifact handling** for actual textbook content
- ‚úÖ **Multi-strategy architecture** with automatic model selection
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive testing** (400+ test cases across all components)

See `CHANGE.md` for detailed success metrics and validation results.

## üìö Topic Classification System

Our core innovation is a **topic-based classification system** that can accurately detect when users are studying specific subjects by analyzing OCR'd text from their screens. The system supports:

- **Multiple AI strategies**: Zero-shot, embedding similarity, hybrid approaches
- **Cross-domain accuracy**: Chemistry, Programming, Machine Learning, Biology, etc.
- **Real OCR content**: Handles textbook chapters, research papers, tutorials
- **Production performance**: Fast enough for real-time study session tracking

## üîÑ Development Philosophy

This project follows **strict TDD practices** and **clean architecture principles**:
- Every feature starts with a failing test
- SOLID principles applied throughout
- No comments in code (self-documenting through clear naming)
- Comprehensive real AI testing with actual models
- Factory pattern for extensible classification strategies

See `development/CLAUDE.md` for complete development guidelines.
